# General

The complexity class P = the set of all decision problems that can be solved by some algorithm in polynomial time

The complexity class NP = the set of all decision problems where yes instances can be verified in polynomial time, given a certificate

P is a subset of NP

No problems proven to be NP and not P

# Non-NP problem

Given a weighted graph and an integer K, is it true that no Hamiltonian Cycle exists with cost <= K?
Seems like we can't verify in polynomial time

# New problem:

Given a graph, does it contain a Hamiltonian cycle?
Instead of solving this problem, we try to verify a solution to the problem
Given a sequence of nodes, we can verify that is

1.  Check that we follow 
2.  Check that its a cycle
3.  Check that each node is visited

# Verification Algorithm

For a problem, it takes a piece of information (certificate) and uses it to verify that an instance has an answer of "yes" (i.e. that it is a yes-instance)

# TSP

## Optimization problem:

Given a weighted graph, find a cheapest Hamiltonian Cycle

## Decision problem:

Given a weighted graph and an integer K, is there a Hamiltonian Cycle with cost <= K?

## Verification Algorithm

Cerificate is the cycle

1.  Check that it is a Hamiltonian cycle
2.  Check that the weighted value is <= K

# Knapsack

## Optimization problem:

Given a set of objects with weight and value, and a size bound, find a subset of objects where size <= bound and where value is maximized

## Decision problem:

Given a set of objects with weight and value, a size bound and an integer K, is there a subset whos size is <= bound and where value >= K?

## Verification Algorithm

Cerificate is set of objects

1.  Add up the set of objects costs
2.  Compares to cost bound
3.  Add up set of objects values
4.  Compare the value to K

# Shortest Path

## Optimization problem:

Given a weighted graph, a start node and a goal node, find a shortest path between them

## Decision problem:

Given a weighted graph, a start node, a goal node and an integer K, is there a path with cost <= K?

## Verification Algorithm

Certificate is a set of nodes

1.  Check that it is a path
2.  Check that the start and end are correct
3.  Check total cost is <= K
