# Matching Problem

## Augmenting Path Algorithm

    start: an empty matching

    while (an augmenting path exists):
        Flip edges along the path

    return: the matching


# Bipartite graph

    Start at an exposed node

    Do a breath first search traversal

    make sure edges alternate (matched/free)

    Don't visit nodes more than once

    Stop if another exposed node is reached

    The search graph has no more nodes than the original graph -> this is a fast algorithm
