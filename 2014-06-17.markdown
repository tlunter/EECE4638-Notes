# Flow Network

Flow f with `|f|` the value of the flow

Discussed previously:

1.  Max flow problem
2.  Residual network
3.  Augmenting path
4.  Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm - find augmenting path, augment along path

## Cutting a flow

Cuts a flow in two `(S,T)`

Flow across a cut is `f(S,T)`

Capacity of a cut `c(S,T)`

`f(S,T) <= c(S,T)`: the flow across a cut must be `<=` the capacity of the cut

### Important Results

1.  For any cut `(S,T)`, `f(S,T) = |f|` the flow across the cut equals the total flow in the network
2.  Since the value of flow = the flow across any cut and since the flow across a cut `<=` capacity of any cut, `|f| <= c(S,T)` for all cuts `(S,T)`
3.  The max flow (or any flow) must be `<=` capacity of a minimum cut (which has minimum capacity).

### Max flow, min cut theorem

If `f` is a flow then the following are all equivalent

1.  f is a maximum flow
2.  the residual flow network has no augmenting paths
3.  the value of the flow = the capacity of some cut

`|f| = c(S,T) for some cut (S,T)`

    A -> B -> C -> A

    A -> B

If `f` is a max flow then the residual flow network has no augmenting paths.
If there was a max flow with an augmenting path, we could produce a bigger flow which is a contradiction.

    C -> A

From `(2)`, `|f| <= c(S,T)` for all cuts.
If `|f| <= c(S,T)` then it can't get any bigger

### Residual Flow Augmenting Paths

If the residual flow network has no augmenting paths, seperate the nodes into 2 groups `S` and `T`.
`S` is the set of nodes reachable from `s`
It must be true that `c(S,T) = f(S,T) = |f|`

Since `A -> B`, `B -> C`, `C -> A`, they are all equivalent.
So the value of the max flow is the value of the cut with the minimum capacity


## Minimum Cost Flow

Image of cost flow network

Each edge `(u,v)` has:

1.  a nonnegative capacity `c(u,v)`
2.  a cost per unit flow `d(u,v)`

Each node `v` has:

`b(v)` a net flow

    b(v) > 0, v is a source
    b(v) < 0, v is a sink
    b(v) = 0, v passes all flow

### Finding a legal flow

If the sum of b = 0, it might have a legal flow

If there is a cut with a capacity less than the positive net flow, can't be a legal flow

We can add a new s and t node with capacities equal to the flows in and out of the sources and sinks.
Find the max flow and see if you can generate enough flow, in and out of the sources and sinks.

Max flow is a special case of min-cost flow.
If we have a min-cost flow solver, we can use it to solve max flow.

Given a flow with an additional arc with unlimited capacity and an expensive cost,
the min-cost flow solver tries to push as much as possible through the normal arcs avoiding the expensive arc.
