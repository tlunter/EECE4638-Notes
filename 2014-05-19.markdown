# Homework 2 Problem 2

1.  In NP, because given the cycle, we can verify the solution.
2.  Seems to be out of NP, since you would need to have all possible solutions
3.  In NP, can be given at least 1 million cycles
4.  In NP, could be given one million cycles with cost less than K
5.  Seems to be out of NP, could be cycles not in the certificate that are less than K

# Reclaiming Solid Waste

There are 3 materials that are inputs.
There are 2 grades of outputs.

|Grade|Specification                       |Profit per pound|
|-----|------------------------------------|----------------|
|A    |Material 1 <= 30%, Material 2 <= 40%|5               |
|B    |Material 2 <= 50%, Material 3 <= 20%|10              |

|Material|Pounds/week|
|--------|-----------|
| 1      | 100       |
| 2      | 200       |
| 3      | 300       |

Goal: Allocate materials to grades to maximize profit

One approach:

    Let ya, yb = the amount of each grade

    za1 = the proportion of grade A that is material 1
    za2 = ...
    za3 = ...
    zb1 = ...
    zb2 = ...
    zb3 = ...

    Maximize 5ya + 10yb

    Subject to: za1 <= 0.3, za2 <= 0.4, ...

    Amount of material 1 in grade A = ya * za1
                            grade B = yb * zb1
    Amount of material 1 = ya * za1 + yb * zb1 <= 100 pounds
    This is a non-liner equation

Another approach:

    Let xa1 = the amount of material 1 in grade A
        xa2 = ..
        xa3 = ..
        xb1 = ..
        xb2 = ..
        xb3 = ..

    xa1 + xb1 <= 100
    xa2 + xb2 <= 200
    xa3 + xb3 <= 300

    xa1 / (xa1 + xa2 + xa3) <= 0.3

    xa1 <= 0.3(xa1 + xa2 + xa3)
    This is a linear equation

    Maximize 5(xa1 + xa2 + xa3) + 10(xb1 + xb2 + xb3)

    Let xj = # of people assigned to shift j

    x1           >= 48
    x1 + x2      >= 79
    x1 + x2      >= 65 <-- redudant (other x1 + x2)
    x1 + x2 + x3 >= 87 <-- redudant (x1 and x2 + x3)
    x2 + x3      >= 64
    x3 + x4      >= 73 <-- redudant (other x3 + x4)
    x3 + x4      >= 82
    x4           >= 43
    x4 + x5      >= 53 <-- redudant (x4 and x5)
    x5           >= 15

    Maximize 170x1 + 160x2 + 175x3 + 180x4 + 195x5

    Optimal solution is X = (48,31,39,43,15)
    Z = 30,610

    The answer is integral, but in general it didn't have to be

    Rounding up would have given a feasible solution, but no necessarily an optimal one

## Lots more with the simplex method

Didn't take notes :X
