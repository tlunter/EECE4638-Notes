# Linear Programming Review

1.  Maximize x1 + 2x2
2.  Subject to x1 < x2

LP formulation linear constraints and objective function

## Graphical

plotting constraints

## Simplex

Use the optimality test

A LPF solution is optimal if its neighbors are worse

## 3D Example

    x1 <= 4
    x2 <= 4
    x1 + x2 <= 6
    -x1 + 2x3 <= 4
    x1,x2,x3 >= 0

Each constant boundary is now a *plane* instead of a *line*
CPF solutions are at the intersection of *three* constants (not two)

The endpoints of edges are adjacent CPF solutions

# Integer-Linear Programming (ILP)

This is an LP problem where one or more variables are restrictde to being integral

ILP is NP-complete -> solving small problems can take a long time

Rounding off an LP solution can give infeasible solutions

## What if the ILP solution is better than the LP solution

IE What if Zilp < Zlp (in a minimization problem)

Not possible, since integral is a subset of the general LP
