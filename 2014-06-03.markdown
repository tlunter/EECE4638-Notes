# Implementing Branch and Bound

Fathomed if:

1.  Worst than best solution so far - value lower than current best
2.  Infeasible solution             - cost too high
3.  Complete solution               - all objects decided

    initialize the list of subproblems
    initialize the best solution found so far
    while the list is not empty {
        select a subproblem
        check to see if its fathomed (infeasible, complete or bounded)
        for the next subject {
            add it --> add it to the list if not fathomed
            don't add it --> add it to the list if not fathomed
            update the best soution found so far if this is a complete solution
        }
    }
